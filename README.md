# ProjectTrace
All the teams should maintain a work-log of progress made each week (This will be collected from commits on this github repo)

Final datasets and code needs to be shared via a GitHub repository (We will need to add steps see below)

##PROJECT PLAN

This project will trace the lifecycle/progress path of the projects funded by the federal agencies.

Go to the NSF website: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/simpleSearchResult?queryText=CSSI 
Go to the NIH website:
Go to the DOE website:
Go to the DOJ website (not sure if this is the correct link: https://bja.ojp.gov/funding/expired?search=CSSI%2C+SI2%2C+DIBBS%2C+CICI%2C+MRI%2C+OAC%2C+CCF&fiscal_year=&sort_by=field_closing_date_value&sort_order=DESC#funding-opportunities-block-3-doe-2a5tck9yjpue
(if they are not easily accessible, email the departmental point-of-contact to procure the data)
Search for the awarded projects on the basis of the keywords below, export the data to CSV files, download each file separately first, and then later merge them all

CSSI

SI2

DIBBS

CICI

MRI

OAC

CCF

Perform “topic modeling” on the abstracts and titles of the awards and find the keywords that describe the awards

For each project, on the basis of the keywords scrape the web to find the publications, news articles, tweets, videos, etc related to the project

Create a database on the basis of the captured data

Create a web-interface for the database

On the basis of the collected data, create a catalog of the products

On each catalog page, list all the information about the project captured from different sources in a standardized format

On the basis of the gathered information, derive insights/statistics that show the impact of the projects on the society

Please discuss the types of heuristics that you would be adopting for defining the impact of the projects with the instructor

Please secure the website appropriately
